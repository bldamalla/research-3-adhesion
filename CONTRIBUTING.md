## Policy on contribution

This project is a school project; hence, contributions are not necessarily accepted under normal circumstances.
If the contributor wants to apply the changes; however, he must consult with the author first.
Email address is given below.

Contributors must work on a fork of the project in a separate branch.
This may be subject to change soon.
Thank you!
